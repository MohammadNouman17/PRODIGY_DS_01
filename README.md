This repository contains a Data Science specified task focused on analyzing the dataset of Titanic. The task involves creating a Histogram and Bar Chart to visualize the distribution of Age of passengers and to display the count of passengers by Gender. 
In this project, I utilized Python as the primary programming language. Specifically, I have used pandas for efficiently loading and manipulating the dataset and matplotlib for basic visualizations of the data. 
The resulting visualizations offer insights into these demographic aspects of the dataset.
